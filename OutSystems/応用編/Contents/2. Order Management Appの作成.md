Outline
In this tutorial, you will build an Order Management application from scratch using Service Studio, the OutSystems IDE.

You will start by creating the Order Management application, defining its data model and then creating two Screens.



In the end, you will be able to open your app in the browser and try it out.

Scenario
We want to build a web application to manage customer orders, which includes controlling the process of receiving, tracking, and fulfilling them. In this tutorial, you will create the Order Management application and its first two Screens:

Orders: lists all the orders and their most important information.
Order Detail: has a Form that allows viewing and editing relevant information of an order, such as date, status, and order code.
You will start from an empty app, with no data or Screens. The first step will then be to import product data from an Excel file.
